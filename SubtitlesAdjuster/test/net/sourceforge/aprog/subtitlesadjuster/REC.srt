1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,039
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,599
Tonight, as usual,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,892
we will share this time...

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,279
Just a second...

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,959
- Where does the shot cut?
- Down here.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,279
Down here? You can't see my...
This hand, right?

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,808
- No.
- OK.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,928
Wait, cut.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,719
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,639
Today on "While you're asleep” we are
accompanying a team of firemen

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,578
on their nightly rounds.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,538
I'm out of breath...

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,279
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,839
Tonight on "While you're asleep"
we'll accompany a team of firemen

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,679
on their rounds through the city.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,279
Not only that, but we'll see
things never before revealed:

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,959
How they live, sleep,
what they eat...

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
We'll get an inside look
at this fire station.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,817
Join us for "While you're asleep. "

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,651
- OK.
- OK?

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,319
If this is a pain in the ass,
just cut, OK?

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,690
I don't want to waste the tape.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,759
Andreu, you're the boss, right?

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,919
The organizer...

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,799
Yes, I'm in charge of this shift,

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,331
both inside the fire house
and out fighting fires.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,559
This is our helmet.
It's a full face helmet.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,319
You can put it on, it's clean.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,373
I'm going to be the heroine of
"While you're asleep".

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,959
Should we put them on?

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,999
It's easy. You're all so huge,
aren't you?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,679
We're big, yes.
These are the boots.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,719
Our pants are inside the boots.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,799
Like in the cartoons, right?
You jump right in them!

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,853
The cartoons copied us,
not the other way around.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,295
I'm a firefighter.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,497
Well, let's see if...

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,679
- if there's a call.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,119
Will you let me go with you?

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,559
- Of course.
- OK.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,279
- It's like a lottery.
- A what?

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,359
A lottery.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,999
We might get a call,
we might not.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,199
We'll see if we do...

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,879
- You'll see, I'll help you out.
- Perfect.

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,039
OK.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,935
We're going to the dining room.
It's dinner time.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,820
- Will they mind if I come in?
- No, not at all.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,359
- They know you're here.
- We can try that...

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,159
...that delicious food
that firemen make.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,879
- Exactly. Very good.
- Let's go.

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,011
Be careful!
You'll hurt yourself.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,453
- Let's go to the dining room.
- This way.

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,839
Hello.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,839
- Bon appetit!
- Thanks!

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,519
Enjoy your meal.

57
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,079
This is Manu and Alex,
they will join you this evening.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,134
Nice to meet you. Please,
keep eating. My name's Angela.

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,652
We'll accompany you tonight.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,559
Finish eating, we'll see you later.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,328
- Do you want to go to the museum?
- Yes, after you.

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,879
Turn around.

63
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,679
I think I'll put it
in your pocket.

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,559
Won't it bother you
when you put on your belt?

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,039
I don't think so.
If it does, we can move it.

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,999
Here you have to do everything.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,733
- Let's see...
- Is this right?

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,159
- Say something.
- One, two...

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,451
- Hello, hello...
- OK, keep going.

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,050
A little more.

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,519
Hello, my name is Manu and
tonight the TV is here.

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,334
- We'll have fun... I don't know.
- OK.

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,775
- Ready?
- Atiny step to your right.

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,999
You know what?
I'm going to change sides.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,814
- Lf you don't mind. It's my hair.
- You're here?

76
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,919
So, Alex, tell us what
a normal night is like

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,858
here in the fire house.

78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,759
A normal night
is pretty monotonous because...

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,239
- Normal?
- Yes, normal.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,119
People think we run around

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,039
putting out fires, but

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,599
around 70% of the calls we get

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,799
are for other types of services.

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,239
- Like what?
- For example,

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,159
broken water mains,

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,439
or pet rescue, too.

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,493
Even though it sounds cliche,
it's true.

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,399
Or to...

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,359
This will sound terrible,
but I'd love the alarm to ring now

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,999
and everyone to run off.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,239
- I don't want anything to happen.
- Let's hope not.

92
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,399
I mean, just to go with you,
to see what your real work is like.

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,679
- Don't get me wrong.
- No, no. I understand.

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,759
- It's more interesting for you.
- So we can show it.

95
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,599
It's more exciting...
Let's hope nothing happens.

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,639
That everything is fine
and nothing happens.

97
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,999
- A routine call, right?
- Exactly.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,919
So, that's a fireman's life.

99
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,688
Waiting, passing time.

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,415
Watching movies

101
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,399
- In the living room, right Alex?
- Let's go there.

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,769
OK.

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,333
I can't take it.

104
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,079
What should we do?
Should we go to reception?

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,574
- All right.
- OK?

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,288
We should do something, right?

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,739
How exciting!

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,770
OK.

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
- Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening.

110
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,319
Finally! Women in the fire station.

111
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,919
Where are you going?

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,415
- I'm sorry...
- Don't be embarrassed.

113
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,689
Time's going by

114
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,930
and it gets quieter.
There's no one here.

115
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,171
The dining room is empty.

116
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,299
They're clean.

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,096
Here they're sleeping.

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,492
When the alarm rings,

119
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,649
they jump out of bed

120
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,611
and slide down here.

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,759
The fire trucks are down there.

122
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,479
We saw them before.

123
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,409
It takes them 3 minutes

124
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,653
to get up.

125
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,377
- We'll finish this later.
- We were winning!

126
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,759
<i>Person trapped in apartment,
in need of rescue.</i>

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,053
<i>Bravo 128 take the call.</i>

128
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,173
What'll we do?

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,759
I can't slide down with the camera.

130
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,130
Let's go that way. Run.

131
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,639
It's all ready.
They're really fast.

132
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,090
You back there.
On the other side.

133
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,136
I don't know if I can...

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,010
It's stuck.

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,799
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,295
Move your legs faster!
One, two, one, two...

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,559
Jose's driving.

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,479
Alex and Manu are the firemen

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,719
we will accompany this evening.

140
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,119
We're going to follow them,
and as we've seen

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,839
it's not always fires
that gets them all moving,

142
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,439
because the entire team goes out.

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,573
Even if it's stopping

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,479
a water leak, or helping someone
out of their apartment,

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,679
or a fire...

146
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,639
Don't you put on the...

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,519
what's it called... the alarm?

148
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,799
We don't normally use it
for services like these

149
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,479
because it's not urgent.

150
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,079
But if you want,
we can put it on, no problem.

151
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,159
- What do you think?
- No, I don't think so.

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,799
No? Well...

153
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,799
What's your show called?

154
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,479
"While you're asleep".

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,658
"While you're asleep"?
Then who watches it?

156
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,359
We have to do another take.
I said alarm, not siren.

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,653
Did it make sense?
Alarm...

158
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,039
- Ready? Come on.
- Let's go.

159
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,216
Let's go.

160
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,519
- What are you taking with you?
- Tools. We have everything

161
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,919
here in this case, tools

162
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,239
to open locks and doors.

163
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,452
We're here with Alex and Manu.

164
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,719
We're almost at

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,057
the house that called for help.

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,479
The police are here.

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,199
We can see a police car.

168
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,319
Maybe it's more serious
than we thought.

169
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,319
- We'll find out soon.
- No, I don't think it is.

170
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,559
Let's go in.

171
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,010
Good evening.

172
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,519
Don't worry.

173
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,731
Awoman was screaming.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,399
We were called
so we came over.

175
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,959
Please calm down.

176
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,639
- Screams? Noises?
- She lives alone with her cats.

177
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,559
- Did you make the call?
- No.

178
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,679
It was me.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,572
- It was you?
- Yes.

180
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,319
I heard screams
so I called the police.

181
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,239
Let's go. She's upstairs.

182
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,656
Let's go upstairs.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,399
It's about time.

184
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,319
We got a call and came over.

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,679
OK, this way please.

186
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,039
- What the hell is this?
- A local TV crew.

187
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,239
Please, stay here.

188
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,879
Sure, we'll sleep here if you want.

189
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,249
Miss, miss!

190
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,772
Please let us work, OK?

191
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,359
- They aren't yours, are they?
- No, they're from a local TV station.

192
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,719
They're doing a report
on how we work

193
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,399
- so they came with us.
- They're your responsibility.

194
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,919
Ladies and gentlemen!

195
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,799
Please stay in the hall.

196
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,897
Am I speaking Greek or what?

197
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,199
If I tell you to stop,
you stop taping.

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,679
If I tell you to get lost,
you get lost. Got it?

199
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,239
Ok. But we have permission.

200
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,959
The old lady lives
on the first floor.

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,239
What happened?

202
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,919
It looks like she fell.

203
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,439
They heard her scream
and called...

204
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,208
What about
those people downstairs?

205
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,039
She was screaming bloody murder.

206
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,599
The neighbors say
she's really weird.

207
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,654
She never goes out,
has no family...

208
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,811
Please, can you go with them?

209
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,291
Go down there.

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,293
Don't they have
anything better to do?

211
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,279
Go downstairs, damn it!

212
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,810
- Get out of the way.
- Sorry, sorry.

213
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,490
- What's the camera doing here?
- They're with the firemen.

214
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,479
We have permission, OK?

215
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,658
I'm going to do an introduction.

216
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,932
- Am I OK here?
- Yeah.

217
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,079
OK.

218
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,759
We're in front of the door

219
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,839
where an elderly resident

220
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,639
has had some sort of problem.
The neighbors heard screams.

221
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,539
Mari Carmen, who called
the fire department

222
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,390
says...

223
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,249
It's OK.

224
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,279
Whoa...

225
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,378
Ma'am, this is the police.

226
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,295
We're here to help you.
Can you hear me?

227
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,399
Ma'am, this is the police.

228
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,260
- Turn off the camera.
- I'm sorry.

229
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,739
Ma'am, can you hear the ambulance?

230
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,416
Don't worry. We're going
to take you to the hospital.

231
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,679
What's her name?

232
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,759
Conchita.

233
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,257
Conchita! Don't worry...

234
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,372
Come on, come on...

235
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,617
Don't worry,
the police are here.

236
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,279
What happened? Is she alright?

237
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,615
Shit...

238
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,297
- The light, please!
- Yeah, turn off the light.

239
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,199
Keep rolling.

240
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,359
- Stop taping!
- Sorry, OK. It's off.

241
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,619
Unit 341, please send
an ambulance immediately.

242
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,579
First floor.

243
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,335
OK. It's very urgent.

244
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,370
The ambulance is here,
don't worry, ma'am.

245
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,919
Sergio, move this, damn it.

246
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,053
I don't want anyone here
while we wait for the ambulance.

247
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,094
Fuck, she's biting him!

248
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,175
Pablo, what do I do?

249
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,931
Get her off him!

250
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,369
Holy shit! Get him out of here!

251
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,015
Help! Help!

252
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,759
- Stay with her, Alex!
- OK.

253
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,959
Help me!
Get out of the way.

254
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,679
Hurry, hurry.

255
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,919
Holy fucking shit!

256
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,879
Get out of the way!

257
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,439
Hurry! Be careful!

258
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,799
- You got him?
- Yeah.

259
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,249
Tape everything.

260
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,649
OK, wait.
Get up!

261
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,690
Pablo, tape fucking everything.

262
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,159
Holy shit, he's going
to bleed to death.

263
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,291
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

264
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,479
Stop, stop.

265
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,999
We have to stop the bleeding.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,999
Come on, quick.
Here.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,212
- I can't!
- Press here!

268
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,119
What the fuck's going on?
The light!

269
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,319
The light!

270
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,656
Quick! The light!

271
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,039
Fuck, come on!

272
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,412
Be careful! Cover it up!

273
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,213
Get out of the way.

274
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,519
They won't let us out.

275
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,639
- Why not?
- I don't know, they said we can't.

276
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,216
This man is wounded.
We have to get him out.

277
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,519
- We have to make a compress.
- Are you a doctor?

278
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,574
- I'm an intern.
- Take him over there.

279
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,719
Be careful with his head.

280
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,818
Hold him up.

281
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,679
Call an ambulance.

282
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,719
The door is blocked from outside.
What the fuck is going on?

283
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,409
We need an ambulance, now!

284
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,039
Calm down, please.

285
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,679
Silence, please!

286
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,811
<i>Please listen.</i>

287
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,039
<i>The health authorities
have decided to seal off</i>

288
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,296
<i>the building for safety reasons.</i>

289
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,330
<i>We're working to get you out
as soon as possible.</i>

290
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,769
<i>We ask for your cooperation.</i>

291
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,599
<i>The agents that are with you</i>

292
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,892
<i>will keep you posted
on what to do.</i>

293
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,159
<i>Follow their instructions</i>

294
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,839
<i>and remain calm. Thank you.</i>

295
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,937
- What the?
- Shit!

296
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,014
341, 341!

297
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,919
Please!

298
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,359
- What do you mean I can't...
- My friend's about to...

299
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,919
<i>We are aware of the situation.
We can't do anything for now.</i>

300
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,359
<i>We'll keep you updated.</i>

301
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,399
- Fuck!
- What did they say?

302
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,759
We have to get him out of here.
He's bleeding to death!

303
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,449
We have to get him out of here.

304
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,319
What's going on?
Why can't we leave?

305
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,418
We just can't.
Just calm down.

306
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,439
Please, stop taping,
for fuck's sake.

307
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,239
- Don't touch the camera!
- Why not?

308
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,919
Do not touch the camera!

309
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,079
We have to let everyone know
what's going on here!

310
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,319
- Fucking hell!
- Calm down.

311
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,279
I'm in charge here, and I say
turn it off and calm down.

312
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,439
Then worry about
what's going on,

313
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,799
not about whether
we tape or not.

314
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,479
Yeah. Find out what's going on.

315
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,089
- Tape this!
- Please!

316
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,534
OK, OK! We have to get
this man out of here!

317
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,479
- What's behind that shutter?
- A textile workshop.

318
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,359
- What do you mean?
- A textile workshop.

319
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,519
OK. Everyone, calm down.

320
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,959
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yes, through the back.

321
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,759
Wait a second,
move over there.

322
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,919
- How does this thing open?
- Please!

323
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,576
I'm not going to repeat this.
Move over there.

324
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,279
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get out of here.

325
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,559
Wait a second!

326
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,239
My husband's outside
and says there are loads of cops.

327
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,479
They've blocked off the street.

328
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,896
He was getting antibiotics for her.

329
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,055
Holy shit!

330
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,879
Alex!

331
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,839
No, don't move him!

332
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,839
- Yes, we have to.
- He has a pulse, don't move him!

333
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,291
- Alex! Alex!
- Shit!

334
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,938
There's somebody upstairs!

335
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,559
- Don't move him!
- Look after him.

336
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,249
Please, come with me.

337
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,972
We're going upstairs.

338
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,136
Nobody move from here, OK!

339
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,616
And you, stop fucking recording!

340
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,239
I don't care what they say,
we have to tape this.

341
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,373
We have to show
what's happening.

342
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,179
- What was that?
- I don't know, be careful.

343
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,489
Fuck!

344
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,657
It's coming from in there.

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,256
- Be careful.
- Where are they?

346
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,778
Move over.

347
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,656
Pablo, don't...

348
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,694
- No, Pablo, come here.
- Be quiet.

349
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,213
Pablo, come here!

350
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,459
What's going on?

351
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,371
What the fuck are you doing here?

352
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,690
Be careful.

353
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,614
She's dead.

354
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,170
Don't move, ma'am.

355
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,692
Ma'am.

356
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,578
Don't move!

357
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,888
Let's go.

358
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,218
She jumped on me...

359
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,399
I know, relax.

360
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,799
- You saw her, right?
- Yeah, I did.

361
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,439
- I couldn't do anything.
- Let's go downstairs.

362
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,999
I know, don't worry.
Let's go.

363
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,528
Fucking asshole!

364
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,610
- Did you get it?
- I got everything.

365
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,919
- Let me see it.
- Don't worry. I got it.

366
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,099
Fucking show it to me!
How do I have to say it?

367
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,495
Get this, Pablo! Come on!

368
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,879
You stay here with the wounded.

369
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,839
I'm going to check the exit.

370
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,175
Just a second.

371
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,999
We have strict orders
to stay in the hall.

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,892
Help me out here.

373
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,199
These men are dying.
Fuck orders!

374
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,856
He's right.
You shouldn't tell us...

375
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,279
There are two dead people,

376
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,519
that died violent deaths.

377
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,679
And two that need urgent
medical attention.

378
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,839
The police have blocked
off the area,

379
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,079
they are keeping us in here,
with no explanations.

380
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,039
So, we're searching
for another way out.

381
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,679
She's getting worse.

382
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,479
Her fever's gone up.
She needs a doctor.

383
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,479
<i>Listen up.</i>

384
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,799
<i>Do not try to leave the building.</i>

385
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,879
<i>All exits have been sealed.</i>

386
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,978
<i>A BNC protocol situation
has been declared.</i>

387
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,199
<i>Shortly a health inspector
will come to assess the situation.</i>

388
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,439
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

389
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,559
Why are we locked in here?

390
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,319
And what do they mean
by a health inspector?

391
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,418
- I don't know.
- What's an BNC protocol?

392
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,759
What's an BNC protocol?
What does BNC mean?

393
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,219
It's a procedure used...

394
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,399
- in Biological, Nuclear, or Chemical threat situations.
- What? Nuclear?

395
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,999
It's more usual than you think.

396
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,279
The wounded are stable,
but they won't hang on much longer.

397
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,679
- We have to get them out of here.
- Obviously not through here.

398
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,359
So, Ladies, Gentlemen,
come this way.

399
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,999
No! There's something more
to this place.

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,359
Our cells don't work.
Neither does the TV or radio.

401
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,119
- We're isolated. Why?
- I don't know why.

402
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,199
I can't get through
to my husband.

403
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,319
- And my daughter has a high fever.
- What's wrong with her?

404
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,133
She has tonsillitis.

405
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,759
- She's burning up.
- What can I do?

406
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,519
From the office
we can jump down on the patio.

407
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,159
I'm going with you.

408
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,415
Where are you going?

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,496
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's not very high up.

410
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,697
How are we going to get in?

411
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,569
What?

412
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,975
The concierge has a copy of the key.

413
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,999
I gave it to him.
I'm in charge of the building.

414
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,699
Let's go.

415
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,599
There was someone else
in the woman's apartment.

416
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,199
What do you mean someone else?
Who?

417
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,933
I don't know. A girl.

418
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,479
Probably the Colombian girl.
Why didn't she come down with you?

419
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,213
She's dead.

420
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,418
Let's go. Open it, quick!

421
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,609
This way.

422
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,649
It's this way.

423
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,379
Let's go.

424
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,735
Help me.

425
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,519
Fuck...

426
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,999
<i>Go back immediately,
for your own safety.</i>

427
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,199
No, listen!

428
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,639
<i>Get back.</i>

429
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,932
<i>We're sealing off the building.</i>

430
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,799
<i>- Ready up there? Go ahead.
- Listen!</i>

431
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,568
Listen to me!

432
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,175
Listen! Can you see me?

433
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,298
Can you hear me?

434
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,679
What are you doing there?
I told you to wait downstairs.

435
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,813
Remember I'm still in charge.

436
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,839
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- About what?

437
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,719
That they're sealing us in.
Like hamsters!

438
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,919
<i>Step back!
For your own safety.</i>

439
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,159
- What the hell is this?
- You tell us!

440
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,519
I don't know!

441
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,799
<i>- I repeat, step back!
- You! That's enough!</i>

442
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,239
- Why?
- Stop messing with the camera.

443
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,479
We have to show
what's going on.

444
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,199
- Don't you get it?
- Don't touch me.

445
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,639
It's the only proof we have.
Can't you see that?

446
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,679
You're locked in here just like us.
They don't care about you either.

447
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,540
Shut up!

448
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,569
Please, go down to the workshop.

449
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,799
- Let's all calm down.
- Shut up!

450
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,012
Yes, we're going. Put the gun down.

451
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,971
<i>Remain calm.</i>

452
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,759
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience.</i>

453
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,119
<i>It is of utmost importance</i>

454
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,199
<i>that you follow the agent's
instructions.</i>

455
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,559
<i>He is in the building with you.</i>

456
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,199
<i>Do not try to leave the building.</i>

457
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,129
<i>I repeat, do not try
to leave the building.</i>

458
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,058
Hold this. Relax, man...

459
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,252
Let's go with the others.

460
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,579
I'm really sorry.

461
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,052
Please, go downstairs.

462
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,051
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

463
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,999
Let me go up to my apartment.

464
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,009
I have sutures and bandages...

465
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,736
Yes...

466
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,479
It's nearly 2 a. m. And we're
still sealed in this building that

467
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,679
we came to with the firemen
earlier this evening,

468
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,799
to assist an elderly lady
who later attacked a policeman

469
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,959
and a fireman. They're both
in critical condition.

470
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,999
The police won't let us leave
and are giving us no explanations.

471
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,519
The neighbors are scared to death.

472
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,079
They want to go back home,

473
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,132
they want to know
what's going on.

474
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,613
Guillem, do you mind if
I ask you a few quick questions?

475
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,999
I've never been in such
a serious situation before.

476
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,239
I'm an intern. I give shots,

477
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,532
take people's blood pressure.
I live in this building.

478
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,529
Well, the injured are
in critical condition.

479
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,279
This is very serious.

480
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,599
The police have several bite wounds.

481
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,319
He's very injured.

482
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,199
What's obvious is that

483
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,359
Mrs. Izquierdo attacked
and bit them.

484
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,759
I guess

485
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,599
she had a fit of hysteria.

486
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,959
But honestly, it's hard to believe.

487
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,999
That...

488
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,039
an old lady could do
something like this to two adults.

489
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,959
I guess when the doctor arrives,

490
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,759
apart from bringing supplies
to treat the wounded,

491
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,599
he'll tell us what's going on.

492
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,159
We're locked in here, the police
are outside, we can't get out,

493
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,399
we have no explanations.
They know these men are here,

494
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,439
and we have to get them out soon.
They've lost a lot of blood.

495
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,279
I can't do anything else.

496
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,730
Stay with them. Thanks.

497
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,879
We're going to keep on interviewing.
If you don't like something

498
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,799
you can cut. OK?

499
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,359
I would like you to tell us

500
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,359
what's happened this evening,

501
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,599
what's gone on.

502
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,759
I can't say too much because
I was sleeping.

503
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,759
I heard loud screams.

504
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,919
Of course I woke him up,
threw on what clothes I could,

505
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,448
and came down here.

506
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,359
I have to change my clothes,
I can't...

507
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,759
Something strange is going on.

508
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,639
Someone did something,
that's why we're locked in here.

509
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,279
This building has always been...

510
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,279
- Wait! Can I talk?
- Why can't I say it?

511
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,599
There's something...

512
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,159
Yes, someone said that there was a...

513
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,319
- An office, a window...
- I don't know what it's called.

514
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,279
A... That there was a...

515
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,279
what they used to do when
there were atomic bombs.

516
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,039
- A BNC protocol.
- A refuge or something.

517
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,879
What a ruckus.

518
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,639
If we knew that when you got here,
we would have said:

519
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,719
Look, this is what happened.
Let everyone know.

520
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,439
- But we have no idea.
- But, in summary...

521
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,812
Fireman, fireman, yes...

522
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,292
Fireman fell! Fireman fell!

523
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,719
- He fell and left...
- Fell from where?

524
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,296
From up there... up, yes.

525
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,599
- You were saying?
- He fell from above.

526
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,174
From where?

527
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,919
Where? I don't know.

528
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,359
But from above, right?
I don't know.

529
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,379
- From the stairwell?
- Yes.

530
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,573
Stairwell like this and...

531
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,959
he fell in the middle. Yes.

532
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,093
Pablo, is this OK or should
I sit lower?

533
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,139
At her level.

534
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,599
What's your name?
I want everyone to know.

535
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,654
- Jennifer.
- What a beautiful name, Jennifer!

536
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,199
- How old are you?
- Seven.

537
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,060
She just had her birthday.

538
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,359
Great. So what happened?
Are you sick?

539
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,695
Yes.

540
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,639
We know you can't take
your medicine, right?

541
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,799
Yes.

542
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,079
Why not?

543
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,799
Because my husband isn't allowed in.

544
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,959
Please do not speak right now,

545
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,679
only the girl is in the shot and...

546
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,879
- Sorry.
- Since there is no microphone,

547
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,839
we can't hear your voice
and everything gets messed up.

548
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,559
We'll interview you later, OK?

549
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,213
You don't have to...

550
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,999
So, besides your father...

551
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,018
Who do you live with?

552
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,319
With my mommy, my daddy

553
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,359
and my dog, Max.

554
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,697
Your dog isn't here either, right?
I can't see him.

555
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,879
No, he's not.

556
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,489
- Do you love your dog?
- Yes.

557
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,851
Why isn't he here?

558
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,535
He's at the vet.

559
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,773
- What's wrong with him?
- He got sick.

560
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,359
I knew something would happen
sooner or later.

561
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,891
A fire or something serious.

562
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,079
There must be something upstairs.

563
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,770
If not, I don't get why people
fall like that...

564
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,079
they fall down through
the stairwell, bleeding all over.

565
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,816
I can't go up to my house.

566
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,609
So, here we are.

567
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,096
I am going to sue.

568
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,999
I am definitely going to sue.

569
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,839
I'm going to call the newspapers,

570
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,099
and have them write
about what happened.

571
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,288
From the beginning until the very end.

572
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,959
- Cesar?
- Hello.

573
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,599
Hi. Sorry, but could I ask you
a few questions?

574
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,538
Wait... OK, yes.

575
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,479
We want to cover the story.

576
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,999
- Are you recording already?
- No.

577
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,178
- OK, rolling.
- Wait, I'll sit like this.

578
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,337
If you prefer
one side in particular...

579
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,719
Have you lived here for long?

580
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,013
Yes, I used to live with my mom.
She died, so now I live alone.

581
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,494
It's the Chinese.

582
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,919
They eat raw.

583
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,599
Raw fish. It smells...

584
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,839
They always leave the door open.

585
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,879
I don't know why.

586
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,999
I mean, if they were the nice kind
that do Feng Shui

587
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,759
and cool stuff... But no.

588
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,639
They come in and out screaming
in Chinese all the time,

589
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,719
in Japanese, I don't know.
Something I don't understand.

590
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,839
When are we starting?

591
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,279
- We did.
- Why didn't you tell me?

592
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,299
Don't you see my face is shiny?

593
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,439
I think this profile's better, right?

594
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,559
- Yes. Great.
- Like this, Pablo?

595
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,736
Good.

596
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,599
OK, silence please.

597
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,573
Silence. Ma'am.

598
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,119
- I just spoke to them outside.
- It's about time!

599
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,413
They told me the health inspector
is on his way in.

600
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,039
- Health inspector?
- Yes.

601
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,959
There is a possible infection
in the building.

602
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,159
An infection?

603
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,599
Yes, but please calm down.

604
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,519
They're just going to take
blood samples

605
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,399
of all the residents
to clarify things.

606
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,658
- Only of the residents?
- No, of everyone here.

607
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,159
When they see everything's OK,

608
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,928
- they'll let us out.
- Great.

609
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,279
We ask you to cooperate.

610
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,879
We're going to check

611
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,199
if everyone is here.

612
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,679
A simple "here” will be fine, OK?

613
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,279
Let's start.

614
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,493
The main floor on the left
is the office where we were before.

615
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,479
Who lives in the apartment
on the right?

616
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,692
That's the Colombian girl's apartment.

617
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,559
First floor, right...

618
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,759
That's where Mrs. Izquierdo
lives, right?

619
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
- First floor, left?
- Me.

620
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,759
Me, my daughter and my husband
who's been outside for a long time.

621
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,759
Yes, we know, lady. Calm down.

622
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,759
- Second floor, left?
- Us.

623
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,719
- You?
- No, we're the third.

624
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,759
- No, we live...
- Do you or don't you?

625
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,999
- Third...
- We live on the second.

626
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,239
- I'm lost.
- Calm down, sir, you're tired.

627
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,999
Second, left.

628
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,519
- Yes. Second, right?
- Present.

629
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,319
- Third, left?
- Here.

630
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,559
- Third, right?
- Yes, that's us!

631
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,919
- You three?
- No, four of us.

632
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,159
- Four?
- My father.

633
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,079
- Your father?
- He upstairs.

634
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,799
- Where is he?
- He on bed.

635
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,399
My father sick.

636
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,839
What she means is
he's old and paralytic.

637
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,039
- Exactly, my father is sick.
- Maybe all this is his fault.

638
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,559
Listen up!

639
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,279
We're going to finish.

640
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,159
Does anyone live in the penthouse?

641
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,119
No, nobody lives there.

642
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,719
A man from Madrid owns it,
but he's never there.

643
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,658
It's been closed up for years.

644
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,639
Excuse me?

645
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,079
- My father come down, yes?
- That's not a good idea,

646
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,799
what if he's the cause of all this.

647
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,239
My father's sick!

648
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,239
- He has to come down here with us.
- I don't understand you.

649
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,399
Be respectful. Calm down.

650
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,759
Your child is sick too and...

651
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,599
My daughter has tonsillitis!

652
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,972
Nobody move until the doctor says so.

653
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,739
<i>We're going in.
Don't open the door until we say so.</i>

654
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,653
<i>Wait.</i>

655
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,919
<i>Go ahead, 341.</i>

656
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,573
OK, over.

657
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,853
What's this?

658
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,418
They'll keep telling us
nothing's wrong, right?

659
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,292
Pablo, I'm going in.

660
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,199
- OK.
- As we...

661
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,359
As we were told, the health inspector
is in the building.

662
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,999
There are incredible
security measures in place.

663
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,479
We know nothing,

664
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,439
they haven't told us a thing.

665
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,959
We saw Special Forces,
health inspectors

666
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,279
wearing suits and masks

667
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,459
and it's not very comforting.

668
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,439
That's all we know.

669
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,733
Take me to them.
The rest stay here.

670
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,972
What is a TV crew doing here?

671
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,199
Jennifer! Don't touch that.

672
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,456
- Why?
- Because I say so.

673
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,575
Pablo, can you come here?

674
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,399
Thanks.
What a pain in the ass.

675
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,693
Don't you think this inspection
has to do with that old lady?

676
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,289
I don't know.

677
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,079
The policeman and the fireman
have been bitten.

678
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,999
If it's contagious, they could react
like the old lady.

679
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,097
Don't scare me...

680
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,298
Fuck, what a day.

681
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,297
Pablo, grab the camera.
I can't sit here doing nothing.

682
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,619
It's recording...
and the lens is dirty.

683
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,655
Someone's been messing around here.

684
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,700
It doesn't matter.
Let's try to get something.

685
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,328
Shit!

686
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,775
Come here.

687
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,089
There. Look.

688
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,055
Hold this.

689
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,579
Be careful, Pablo.

690
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,094
Give it to me.

691
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,412
Can you see anything?

692
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,379
What can you see?

693
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,337
- They're handcuffing him.
- Who?

694
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,577
Pablo, what can you see?

695
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,051
Tell me what you see!

696
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,650
Say something!

697
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,651
- What are they saying?
- I can't hear them.

698
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,850
- What's that?
- What?

699
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,258
I don't know. The doctor
has something in his hands.

700
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,999
- It's a needle.
- What's he doing?

701
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,894
- I don't know. Wait.
- What are they doing, Pablo?

702
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,218
They're injecting the fireman
with something.

703
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,935
Pablo!

704
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,336
More handcuffs.

705
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,016
- Holy shit!
- What's going on?

706
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,575
Shit!

707
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,851
What's that, Pablo?

708
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,138
Say something!
What's going on in there?

709
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,298
Why are they screaming?

710
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,652
Pablo, answer me!

711
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,359
Go, go. Run!

712
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,279
- What's going on in there?
- Go, go!

713
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,298
What's going on?

714
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,399
What are you doing?
Guillem's in there.

715
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,879
Guillem's still in there!

716
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,279
He got bitten, we can't let him out.

717
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,159
- What are you talking about?
- He didn't bite me!

718
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,359
It spreads through saliva.

719
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,639
We can't risk letting him out.

720
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,999
We don't know if he's been bitten!

721
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,839
The infected ones are handcuffed.

722
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,479
Just stay away from them.

723
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,319
Infected with what?

724
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,359
- What's going on?
- A minute ago they were fine!

725
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,239
What the fuck is all this about?

726
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,533
The reaction time depends
on the blood type. We can't predict...

727
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,139
Fuck! Hurry up! Run!

728
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,857
Come on, hurry up!

729
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,359
Now tell us
what the hell is going on here.

730
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,519
- I'm not authorized...
- Bullshit!

731
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,839
I just killed a cop
who tried to bite us.

732
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,639
Tell us everything you know.

733
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,737
OK.

734
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,977
Yesterday we received

735
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,399
a call from a vet

736
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,613
who had a dog brought in
with an unknown disease.

737
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,331
The dog went into a coma

738
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,499
and a few moments later came to

739
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,319
and was extraordinarily aggressive.

740
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,259
He started attacking all of
the pets at the clinic.

741
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,679
We had to give him
several tranquilizers

742
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,399
and then put him to sleep.

743
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,488
We followed the chip in his ear
which led us to this building.

744
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,692
- Was the dog called Max?
- Yes.

745
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,199
She only has tonsillitis.

746
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,173
- Bullshit, tonsillitis.
- Relax, ma'am...

747
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,079
We just have to be sure.

748
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,974
Calm down.

749
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,279
It's just tonsillitis.

750
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,639
We think the dog spread the infection

751
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,359
through his saliva.

752
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,979
If that's true...

753
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,519
Handcuffs! Get the handcuffs!

754
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,839
- Hold her!
- Jennifer!

755
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,576
Jennifer!

756
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,456
The cuffs!

757
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,479
Jennifer!

758
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,056
Relax, we'll get her.

759
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,079
Father downstairs.
My father come down!

760
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,799
- What father?
- Her father's sick in bed.

761
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,692
And you didn't tell me?

762
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,497
We can't have infected people
loose out there.

763
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,519
We gave you specific orders
to get everyone together downstairs.

764
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,653
We had no idea. We thought
everyone was here.

765
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,399
Take this. Get her
and inject her with this.

766
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,199
Everyone must come down here.

767
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,319
Get this on tape!

768
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,338
Be careful, Pablo!

769
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,728
Jennifer?

770
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,650
What the hell is that?

771
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,778
Fucking hell!

772
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,732
- The old lady isn't there.
- Neither is the other one.

773
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,259
Jennifer?

774
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,934
Jennifer.

775
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,737
There's no one here. Wait.

776
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,971
She's over there. Look!

777
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,974
Fuck!

778
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,376
Jennifer, relax.

779
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,999
Relax.

780
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,199
Give me the needle.
The needle!

781
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,899
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

782
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,892
Be careful, man.

783
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,175
Jennifer.

784
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,253
Relax.

785
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,932
Give me your hand.

786
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,458
- Be careful.
- Give me your hand.

787
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,776
What happened to her eyes?

788
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,894
Shit!

789
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,008
Be careful!

790
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,614
Shit! Get out of the way!

791
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,216
Go, she bit me!

792
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,254
She bit me, can't you see?

793
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,611
Go, for fuck's sake!

794
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,409
Go!

795
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,979
Let's go!

796
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,260
No down!

797
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,378
Don't go down there!

798
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,058
They're getting away!

799
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,411
Help me!

800
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,799
Take these off of me!

801
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,319
- Don't touch me!
- Son of a bitch!

802
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,134
Take them off!

803
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,679
I don't have it.

804
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,919
I don't have the key!

805
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,519
What do you mean?

806
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,999
- The policeman has it.
- Fuck!

807
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,336
- The shutter!
- What?

808
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,616
Help!

809
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,933
Help, you bastard!

810
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,859
Don't go!

811
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,159
Get away!

812
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,257
We have to get her out of here.

813
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,719
- Let's go.
- No!

814
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,239
I'm sorry!

815
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,849
Don't leave me here!

816
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,679
This way, come on.

817
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,299
Hurry up!

818
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,693
The lock!

819
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,639
It looks like they're leaving.

820
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,532
They're going upstairs.

821
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,239
- Were you bitten?
- No.

822
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,239
- Angela?
- No.

823
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,119
- You?
- No.

824
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,199
- Did you find the little girl?
- Who cares about the girl?

825
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,411
It's out of control.

826
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,217
Pablo, what the hell were they
doing to that woman?

827
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,439
They were eating her alive, Manu.
What the hell is this?

828
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,599
I don't know!

829
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,573
They could all be infected by now.

830
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,639
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm not moving!

831
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,933
No! We can stay here

832
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,719
until they come to get us.
These things...

833
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,479
No one's going to come get us!

834
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,439
- Yes!
- Open your fucking eyes!

835
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,919
They don't give a shit!
They're going to let us die here!

836
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,319
But the doctor
does matter to them.

837
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,199
- They'll come get the doctor.
- The doctor? Why?

838
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,799
- He is in there.
- Son of a bitch!

839
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,679
- Where?
- There!

840
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,619
I'm gonna kill you!

841
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,454
I've been bitten. Go away.

842
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,579
Get lost.

843
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,599
I've been bitten!

844
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,128
Get back!

845
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,759
Go away!

846
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,459
Shit, shit...

847
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,319
The door won't hold.

848
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,896
- Go away.
- Son of a bitch!

849
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,159
Get us out of here!

850
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,519
<i>Stand away from the windows!</i>

851
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,599
<i>We repeat:
Stay away from the windows</i>

852
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,839
<i>or we will be forced
to take drastic measures.</i>

853
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,610
<i>Follow the inspector's
instructions.</i>

854
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,211
There might be a way out.

855
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,293
Pablo, there might be a way out!

856
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,199
Listen!

857
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,639
There's an underground storage
area in the workshop

858
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,615
that has a drain cover that joins
up with the sewers.

859
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,569
Can you hear me?

860
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,239
- In the workshop there's a basement...
- Are you sure?

861
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,399
Yes, we can escape through there.
The problem is the reinforced door.

862
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,851
- How the hell will we open it?
- With the key!

863
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,959
The intern is in charge.
He has all the keys.

864
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,728
- Where?
- In his apartment.

865
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,679
Let's go! Let's go!

866
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,857
He's been bitten!

867
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,731
Hurry up!

868
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,694
They're not there.

869
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,719
Manu, we have to find the way out.
We need the storage key.

870
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,039
Yeah, but... how?

871
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,119
The intern has the key,
but we don't know where he lives.

872
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,012
You checked the list!

873
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,279
- I can't remember.
- Pablo?

874
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,298
I don't remember either.

875
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,093
Manu, think.
I'm sure you can remember.

876
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,890
- I can't remember!
- Think, Manu!

877
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,459
Guillem! The mailboxes!

878
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,379
He's called Guillem...

879
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,319
Downstairs, quick!
Angela, hurry up!

880
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,292
Hurry up!

881
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,529
Guillem Marimón, third floor nº2!

882
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,569
She's cuffed.
We can get by.

883
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,689
We have to go upstairs.

884
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,689
Upstairs!

885
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,174
Be careful, Angela!

886
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,573
Pablo, help me!

887
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,610
Wait. OK.

888
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,729
Drop her.

889
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,319
- I got bitten!
- No, you didn't.

890
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,479
I saw it. You didn't.

891
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,719
Let's go upstairs.
Pablo, help.

892
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,319
- Come on, get up.
- I got bitten!

893
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,439
You did not, Angela.
I saw it, you didn't.

894
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,335
Let's go, Pablo! Hurry up!

895
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,534
Hurry up!

896
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,879
Shit!

897
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,159
- The light!
- Where's the switch?

898
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,199
- On the wall!
- I can't find it!

899
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,619
- Pablo, the spotlight! Turn it on!
- I'm trying!

900
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,257
Quickly!

901
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,649
Move it! Move it!

902
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,449
Shit! Go upstairs, hurry!

903
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,174
The mallet, Angela!

904
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,371
Go upstairs, quickly!

905
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,449
It's here.

906
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,015
Move.

907
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,698
Hurry up. I'll wait here.

908
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,374
I'll go there.

909
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,979
Where are they?

910
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,258
Look in the drawers.

911
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,248
Where the hell are they?

912
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,012
We have to get out.

913
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,132
- Here, here!
- Shit, where are they?

914
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,369
Shit!

915
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,699
The keys...

916
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,609
Where are...

917
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,051
The keys!

918
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,489
Which ones are they?

919
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,959
Which ones are they?

920
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,296
I don't know. Grab them all.

921
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,169
Let's go.

922
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,777
Where's Manu?

923
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,319
Upstairs, run!

924
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,612
Go to the penthouse!
The key must be in the bunch.

925
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,368
Come on, Angela!

926
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,213
Which one is it?

927
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,493
This one!

928
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,334
- Turn on the spotlight.
- I can't!

929
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,279
- The light is loose.
- Fix it, Pablo!

930
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,332
I'm trying!

931
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,776
They're leaving.

932
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,770
- Pablo, turn it on!
- Calm down.

933
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,879
This is the apartment
that was closed up.

934
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,173
- No one will be in here.
- Turn it on, please.

935
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,016
OK.

936
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,569
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

937
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,849
What the hell is all this?

938
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,339
Pablo, over here.

939
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,019
Where?

940
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,419
Holy shit!

941
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,891
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

942
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,855
- Pablo!
- What?

943
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,616
"The Vatican is investigating...

944
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,698
the possible possession
of a Portuguese girl. "

945
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,479
PORTUGAL IS MOVED BY
THE CASE OF A POSSESSED GIRL

946
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,896
- Fuck...
- The possessed girl.

947
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,639
THE MEDEIROS CASE ON HOLD

948
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,578
Pablo, look!

949
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,730
It's the same girl!

950
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,169
What the hell is this?

951
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,239
It's all about the same.

952
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,533
"The hospital denies releasing
the girl who disappeared in the night"

953
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,531
Pablo!

954
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,039
Calm down.

955
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,934
It must be the pipes.

956
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,414
Calm down, we'll find a way out.

957
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,691
We have to get out of here.

958
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,737
Be careful. Stay close.

959
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,852
Didn't they say no one lived here?

960
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,097
Calm down.

961
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,039
Pablo.

962
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,535
Over here.

963
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,613
What's that?

964
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,009
They're still talking about the same.

965
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,319
What the hell is this?

966
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,879
- Angela, let's go.
- Wait!

967
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,138
It must have something
to do with...

968
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,449
Look!

969
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,937
A tape recorder.

970
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,250
- There's no electricity.
- It's off.

971
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,736
There.

972
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,119
<i>I've finally isolated the enzyme.</i>

973
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,615
<i>The problem is that it's unstable.</i>

974
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:46,128
<i>It deteriorates when it
comes into contact with oxygen.</i>

975
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,971
<i>I am, however, optimistic.</i>

976
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,974
<i>If all goes well
we'll have a vaccine soon.</i>

977
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,759
<i>The analyses were successful.</i>

978
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,937
What the hell is he talking about?

979
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,458
<i>Something unexpected has happened.</i>

980
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,453
<i>The enzyme is not only resistant
but has mutated.</i>

981
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,254
<i>It behaves much like the flu.</i>

982
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,540
<i>This leads us
to a horrible conclusion.</i>

983
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,839
<i>It might be contagious.</i>

984
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,619
I don't get it.

985
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,531
<i>The telegram from Rome
has arrived.</i>

986
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,039
<i>The Medeiros girl
must die.</i>

987
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,535
He's talking about the girl, Pablo.

988
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,259
She was here.

989
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,719
<i>I must eliminate her and erase
all signs of her existence.</i>

990
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,679
What the hell is this guy saying?

991
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,719
<i>Finally my prayers
have been answered.</i>

992
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,759
We have to get out of here.

993
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,858
<i>This decision should
have been made years ago.</i>

994
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,095
<i>This has all been a big mistake.</i>

995
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,079
<i>I must follow the procedures.</i>

996
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,530
<i>The ritual is very specific.</i>

997
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,599
Come here. Stay close.

998
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,130
<i>I'm going to seal off the room.</i>

999
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,059
<i>The seal should keep her in.</i>

1000
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,410
<i>If anything goes wrong,
may God help us.</i>

1001
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,809
Wait.

1002
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,639
- I'm going to look.
- No!

1003
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,799
There might be a way out
through the attic.

1004
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,759
- We have to give it a try.
- What are you going to do?

1005
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,449
I'll record what's up there
and we can look at it.

1006
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,839
Pablo. Bring the camera down.

1007
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,415
There are really weird noises.

1008
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,479
- What happened?
- Something hit the camera.

1009
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,199
Turn it on.

1010
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,439
The fucking light broke!

1011
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,574
- Turn it on, Pablo!
- I can't, it's busted.

1012
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,239
- Fuck! What now?
- Relax. Don't move.

1013
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,531
I'll turn on the night vision.

1014
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,980
OK, I can see you now.

1015
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,690
That's good.

1016
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,879
Stick your hand out.

1017
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,740
- I can't see you. Where are you?
- OK, I got you.

1018
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,409
Relax, it's me.

1019
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,239
I can see if I use the camera.

1020
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,895
Get behind me and don't let go.

1021
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,773
We'll be OK.
We're going to get out.

1022
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,999
I'll find the way out.

1023
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,938
Don't let go, OK?

1024
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,096
- Stay still.
- Why?

1025
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,131
There's something.
Go back.

1026
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,933
Don't make a sound.

1027
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,729
Get down.

1028
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,128
Keep quiet, for God's sake!

1029
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,208
It can't see us.
If it can't hear us, it won't find us.

1030
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,412
Let's go.

1031
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,016
- Run!
- Pablo!

1032
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,098
Run!

1033
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,497
Answer me!
I can't hear you!

1034
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,169
Pablo.

1035
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,450
We have to tape everything, Pablo.
For fuck's sake.
